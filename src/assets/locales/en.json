A custom data collection script was developed to gather 6M+ market-related social media posts, along with stock price data for the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Users were classified into two categories (bot or human) based on the content of their posts using an anomaly detection architecture that leverages a Variational Autoencoder and the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, taking into account the unbalanced nature of the data. Sentiment analysis was conducted on the social media content using BERT embeddings as input for the neural network, enabling the classification of the emotional tone of social media posts. A custom engagement metric based on the content's metadata was proposed, and the correlation between this engagement metric and the asset's price fluctuations was analyzed.",

Using statistical measures like the Jaccard Similarity Index and Kendall's Ï coefficient, we analyzed the collected data for evidence of price steering and discrimination. Our analysis revealed strong indications of price steering but limited evidence of price discrimination. To examine Amazon's buy-box recommendations, we implemented a Random Forest classifier that achieved 80% accuracy in predicting the recommended seller, with product price and seller metrics as key features.

The core of our analysis employed SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables) models to account for the non-stationary nature of financial time series, including trends and seasonality. We compared these results against traditional OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression to highlight the importance of considering time-dependent structures in financial data. The SARIMAX models were optimized using cross-validation and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select the best hyperparameters. Our analysis revealed sector-specific sensitivities to interest rate changes, with real estate and consumer goods showing the most significant responses, while providing insights into the complex dynamics of Brazil's financial markets.",

We developed custom web scraping tools and utilized Yelp's API to collect data on over 13k restaurants, including details on 250k reviews, ratings, and geographical information. Using statistical analysis and regression models, we examined the economic incentives behind fake reviews, finding that lower-priced and lower-rated restaurants tended to have slightly higher percentages of fraudulent reviews. We also employed sentiment analysis and polarity detection on review text to differentiate characteristics of fake versus genuine reviews. Our analysis leveraged Python for data collection and processing, along with libraries like pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. The project provided insights into the dynamics of online review platforms and the factors influencing review fraud in the restaurant industry.",
